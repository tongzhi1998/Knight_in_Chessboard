# Knight_in_Chessboard
Find n Knights in A m*m ChessBoard

Author: Tong Zhi

Problem Description:
Given a m*m chessboard with n knights on it, every time we can flip a specific grid and it will show a number which represents the number of steps that the cloest knight can reach it. We need to design an algorithm that can sucessfully find all knights in fewest amount of tries.

File Description:
Board.cpp contains the main implementation of the algorithm. Knight_Test.cpp contains some specific tests I write, feel free to try out different numbers! I am still working on the consolePrinter to print out GUI demonstration of my algorithm step by step.
